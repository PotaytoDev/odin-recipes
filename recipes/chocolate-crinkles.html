      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Chocolate Crinkles are soft, slightly crunchy, fudgy and chocolatey cookies that are covered in confectioners' sugar and have a taste similar to brownies!</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, mix together cocoa, white sugar, and vegetable oil. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the cocoa mixture. Cover dough, and chill for at least 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into one inch balls. I like to use a number 50 size scoop. Coat each ball in confectioners' sugar before placing onto prepared cookie sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Let stand on the cookie sheet for a minute before transferring to wire racks to cool.
