# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes - from The Odin Project

This project consists of creating a simple website for recipes. It is a practice project designed to test the skills learned so far through the The Odin Project curriculum in regards to HTML concepts and git.
The project website itself consists of an index page containing links to recipes.

By the end of this project, I will have acquired a better grasp of the HTML concepts covered thus far. Namely, the HTML boilerplate will be used, ideally from memory, as well as HTML elements; the most important of which will likely be the anchor element, or <a>. Additionally, I will have been able to demonstrate my skills in regards to using the git workflow in order to save my documents as I proceed, and use GitHub as a remote repository to showcase the project itself.
